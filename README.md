# WordReveal-Challenge
The Hidden Word Guesser is a Python program that initiates by prompting the player to input a word, validating it based on length and uppercase character criteria. After a valid word is entered, the game starts. The player endeavors to guess individual letters, and the program updates a hidden word representation accordingly. The player has a restricted number of attempts to guess the word, and the game concludes either when the word is fully guessed or when the attempts are exhausted. Victory is achieved if the player successfully reveals the hidden word within the given attempts; otherwise, they lose.
